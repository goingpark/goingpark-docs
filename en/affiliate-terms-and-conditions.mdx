# GoingPark Affiliate Program Terms and Conditions
*Last updated: May 8, 2024*

## Acceptance of Terms
By joining the GoingPark Affiliate Program, you agree to these terms and conditions. We reserve the right to update or modify these terms at any time.

## Purpose and Responsibility of Promotion
The core objective of our affiliate program is to use our partners' traffic to attract new customers to GoingPark, and we reward our affiliates through commissions. GoingPark highly values its relationships with affiliates and is honored to share the joy of success with many partners. We sincerely appreciate and welcome the active promotion and publicity efforts of all affiliates. To maintain a fair and equitable affiliate environment, we have established clear rules and strictly oppose any dishonest behavior that attempts to steal others' efforts or falsify traffic. Our goal is to ensure that honest affiliates, who genuinely bring new users to GoingPark, receive the rewards they deserve.

- Affiliates must promote GoingPark's services in an honest and legal manner, aiming to increase GoingPark's visibility and attract new users.
- Affiliates should avoid misleading promotions and ensure that the information provided is accurate and truthful.
- Affiliates must actively promote GoingPark's services, using lawful and legitimate means to attract new users.
- Affiliates should maintain accurate and positive descriptions of the GoingPark brand and services, avoiding any behavior that could damage GoingPark's reputation.
- Affiliates must keep all information related to the program confidential, including but not limited to commission rates and other trade secrets.

## Affiliate Requirements
Applicants must have a valid social media account/public page, website, or a community channel with valid traffic.

## Promotional Links and Tracking
- We will provide exclusive promotional links or promotional codes (distribution of promotional codes depends on the quality of the traffic channel) and tracking tools.
- Affiliates must ensure correct use of the links to track conversions and commissions.

## Commissions and Payment
- Commissions are based on valid sales completed through your promotional links.
- GoingPark reserves the right to evaluate affiliate promotion performance and adjust future commission rates.
- The commission payment account will depend on the payment account information you provided during the application.
- The commission settlement cycle and method are subject to the real-time commission settlement rules on the website.

### Transfer Fees
Due to different transfer methods, different fees may be incurred during the transfer process. Please note that these fees are not charged by us but are fees charged by the transfer channels to us. We will clearly inform you of the specific fee amount during the withdrawal process to ensure you understand the actual amount received.

- GoingPark reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to withhold any commissions indefinitely, and/or revoke, reject, or deny any commission fees, and/or refuse or deny any affiliate account, and/or immediately terminate this agreement due to:
  - (i) commissions generated through improper means or fake users.
  - (ii) commissions resulting from actions explicitly prohibited by this agreement.
  - (iii) any dishonest promotion using misleading websites or social media accounts.

- **Commission Deductions**: Since GoingPark pre-pays the full commission to affiliates before users complete their entire subscription, in the event of a refund, the commission for the corresponding refund order will be deducted from the affiliate's earnings, which may reduce the available withdrawal balance. If the user makes a subsequent purchase using the refund amount from their GoingPark wallet, the relevant commission will be recalculated based on the current commission settlement rules.

## Marketing Activities
- Affiliates must comply with the terms and rules of social media platforms in their country/region.
- If an affiliate deletes or hides competitor website advertisements or for personal reasons causes their platform and advertisements to become non-public, GoingPark reserves the right to cancel the affiliate's promotion qualification or adjust the commission ratio.
- If GoingPark suspects fraudulent activity by an affiliate, we may require proof that these referrals are valid.
- Promotional codes are intended solely to attract new users to GoingPark; any registrations obtained through illegal means will not be counted towards promotional results.

## Principles of Fair Cooperation
The following behaviors are prohibited during participation in the GoingPark Affiliate Program:

- **Coupon Sites**: To maintain a fair cooperation environment, we recommend affiliates share promotional codes through legitimate channels.
- **Spammers**: GoingPark does not support promotion through spam.
- **Unfair Competition**: Avoid using any unfair means to compete or infringe upon the rights of other affiliates.
- **Impersonation**: It is prohibited to impersonate others or mislead others into believing you are an official representative of GoingPark.
- **Abuse of Promotional Codes**: Misuse of promotional codes is prohibited, such as earning commissions through self-purchase or fake purchases.

## Intellectual Property
You must respect all of GoingPark's logos, trademarks, and copyrights.

## Termination of Agreement
- If you violate these terms, we reserve the right to terminate your membership at any time.
- Affiliates may terminate this agreement at any time and stop using promotional links.

## Disclaimer
GoingPark is not responsible for any direct or indirect loss, damage, or expenses incurred by affiliates due to their participation in this program, unless such losses are caused intentionally or willfully by GoingPark.

## Notice of Changes
For any significant changes to these terms, we will notify affiliates in advance.
