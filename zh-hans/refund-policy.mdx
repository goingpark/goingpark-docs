GoingPark Refund Policy
====================

Your historical order information query address: [https://goingpark.com/order](https://goingpark.com/order)

If you encounter the problem during your usage of subscription and do not accept the solution that customer service proposed and request a refund, the following is the refund policy:

1\. Standard Subscription Refund Policy
---------------------------------------

Regular subscription categories include: Tidal, Crunchyroll, Max, NF, YoTube, Deezer, Office 365.

1\. Ten days before the subscription expires, the order status will change to Completed, and we will no longer accept your refund requests.

\*Example: Your order was created at 08:00 on January 1, 2022, and you can apply for a refund before 08:00 on January 2, 2022.

2\. Orders that have already been refunded or are in the process of being refunded do not support further refund requests.

3\. If you request a refund from customer service when the subscription is in the Delivered status due to personal reasons, GoingPark may ban your account depending on the situation, as this behavior violates GoingPark's refund policy and terms.

4\. Reminder: After your YoTube subscription is refunded, we will delete your account from the YoTube Premium Family Group. After your YoTube account is deleted, you will not be able to join other premium family plans for 12 months. Please apply for a refund with caution.

2\. Special Subscription Refund Policy
--------------------------------------

Special subscription categories include: Spotfy, etc

1\. Trial Period for Refund Requests: Special subscriptions enter a trial period for 24 hours after order creation, during which refunds can be requested. For example, if an order is created on January 1, 2022 at 08:00, a refund can be requested until January 2, 2022, at 08:00.

2\. Policy After 24 Hours: After 24 hours from the order creation, the order status is updated to "Completed". Requesting a refund due to personal reasons after this period is considered a violation of GoingPark's refund policy, terms, and conditions. This is because once these subscriptions are delivered or activated, they cannot be reverted to their original state. Depending on the situation, GoingPark may take action to disable your account.

3\. Refund Amount Principle
---------------------------

The amount of refund you will get = order amount/total duration of the order \* remaining time of the order-the handling fee required for payment and refund (According to the refund rules of each payment gateway)
